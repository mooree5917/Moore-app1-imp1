The purpose of this application is to allow a user to set up a To Do List. This list will allow said user to create an item in this case we will be calling a list, the list will have a title so the user can distinguish it from other lists on the main application listing screen. The next part of creating the list will allow the user to write a description on what they might need to get done (i.e. grocery list, errands, etc) and a due date they can select from a calander. Two buttons will be at the button to finalize the list or just cancel it.

On the main screen of the application will be a rows of other lists that might be empty or hold other made lists created by the user. Columns will be used to separate a check mark, the list title, due date, and description. At the bottom will be three buttons to add a list, delete a list, or edit a list. I wanted a user to be able to click on a list which highlights it then they can select a button. If the user chose delete a warning would pop up asking the user if they are sure with the title being "*List Title* is about to be deleted are you sure?"
